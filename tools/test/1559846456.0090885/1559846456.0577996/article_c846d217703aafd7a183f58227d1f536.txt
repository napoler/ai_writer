**BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY** :The Bichon Frisé was brought to France from Italy during the Renaissance. Asit looked like a very small Barbet, it was given the name of “barbichon” whichwas then shortened to “bichon”. In the 17th and 18th centuries, many renownedpainters depicted these little dogs which accompanied kings, nobles and othernoteworthy persons. The breed came back into fashion under Napoléon III, andit was known at that time as the “Ténériffe”. It was then popularized,becoming well-liked in both Belgium and France. It almost disappeared afterthe two world wars. It is thanks to the passion of a few French and Belgianbreeders that a population was able to be reconstituted. The first dog,registered in Belgium, was Pitou, born on 23rd March 1924 and was registeredin the Belgian studbook (LOSH) in 1932. N° 1 in the French studbook (LOF) wasattributed to Ida, a female Bichon Frisé on 18th October 1934. The currentFrench name – Bichon à poil frisé – was given in 1978 and was recognized as aFranco-Belgian breed.**历史沿革 ：**比熊犬在文艺复兴时期从意大利被带到法国，它看起来像小型巴贝特犬，因此被命名为“巴比熊”（意为小巴贝特），后简称为“比熊”。
17和18世纪，许多著名画家曾描绘这些小狗陪伴在王公贵族、达官显贵左右。
该犬种在拿破仑三世时期重新流行起来，那时以“特内里费”而著称。
随后在法国和比利时都广受欢迎。
两次世界大战过后，此犬几乎灭绝。
多亏有一群法国和比利时育种家，在他们的努力下种群得以重建。
比利时登记的第一只比熊“皮图”，出生于1924年3月23日，1932年在比利时（LOSH）登记注册。
1934年10月18日，法国第一只有记录的比熊母犬“艾达”完成登记。
卷毛比熊现在的法语名字“Bichonà poil frisé”在1978年命名，被认为是一个法国-比利时犬种。
